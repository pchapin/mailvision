  <title>Supported Standards</title>

  <para>MailFlux supports only open standards. MailFlux follows the traditional policy of all
    Internet server programs by trying to accept any input that it can; however, MailFlux will
    flag all standards violations that it sees. Furthermore MailFlux will not normally allow any
    standards violations to occur in its outgoing communications.</para>

  <para>There are many standards related to email and it seems like new ones are created every
    month. MailFlux can not know about every email standard. Since new standards are designed to
    layer on top of old standards, MailFlux will handle many of the new standards by just
    leaving the data used by them uninterpreted.</para>

  <para>The current version of MailFlux understands the following standards.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>RFC-5321. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. MailFlux does not currently implement any
        extensions.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Future versions of MailFlux may also support other standards such as SMTP extensions,
    digital signature and encryption standards, and various widely used extensions.</para>
