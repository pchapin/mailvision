  <title>Building MailFlux</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build MailFlux and associated documentation. Currently the
    tools used to create this application are as listed below. The version numbers given are for
    the versions used by the MailFlux developers. Other versions of each tool may also work. In
    addition, tools from other vendors may work although some of the build scripts and
    configuration files would likely need to be updated first. This document does not describe
    how to install these tools; consult the corresponding documentation for each tool for that
    tool's installation instructions.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>GNAT GPL 2014. Certain GNAT extensions (mostly GNAT specific library packages and
          GNAT's support for SPARK) are used. Currently no other Ada compiler is
          supported.</para>

      <term>XSLT Styling Engine</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Xalan v2.6.0. This is a Java program. The latest version can be downloaded from
          the Apache Project site at <ulink url="http://xml.apache.org/"/>. In order to execute
          Xalan you will also need a suitable Java runtime system installed.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Formatting Object Processor</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>FOP v0.20.5. This is also a Java program. The latest version can be downloaded
          from the Apache Project site at <ulink url="http://xml.apache.org/"/>. As with Xalan
          you will also need a suitable Java runtime system installed in order to execute FOP.
          Note that the current version of FOP is unfinished and it produces a number of errors
          when used with the stylesheets below. These errors can be ignored. The resulting
          document is servicable regardless.</para>
