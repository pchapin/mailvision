    <para>This document is for people interested in working on the MailFlux program itself. If
      you are only interested in using MailFlux you do not need to read this document. If, on
      the other hand, you are interested in extending MailFlux or in fixing a bug in the
      MailFlux code base, you should review this document before you get started. This document
      assumes you are already familiar with MailFlux and with the contents of the User's
      Guide.</para>

    <para>MailStop is written in Scala. It also makes use of a number of additional libraries
      and tools, discussed in more detail elsewhere.</para>
