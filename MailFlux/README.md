MailFlux
========

This project is an SMTP mail transport agent written in C++, although there is a significant,
partial implementation in Java also available. The Java version was used in the network
programming class at Vermont State University where students had more Java experience than C++
experience.

To build the program and associated documentation and tests execute the following:

    $ make
    
Support files for the CLion IDE are also available.
