  <title>Building MailStop</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build MailStop and associated documentation. Currently the
    tools used to create this application are as listed below. The version numbers given are for
    the versions used by the MailStop developers. Other versions of each tool may also work. In
    addition, tools from other vendors may work although some of the build scripts and
    configuration files would likely need to be updated first. This document does not describe
    how to install these tools; consult the corresponding documentation for each tool for that
    tool's installation instructions.</para>

      <term>Ada Compiler</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>GNAT GPL 2017. Certain GNAT extensions (mostly GNAT specific library packages and
          GNAT's support for SPARK) are used. Currently no other Ada compiler is
          supported.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>oXygen</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The documentation is written in DocBook using the oXygen XML editor. It is not
          necessary to use that particular XML editor. Any text editor could be used provided
          you also install an XSTL styling engine, a formatting object processor, and DocBook
          stylesheets. The oXygen tool comes with all of these things. However, oXygen is also a
          commercial product.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>XSLT Styling Engine</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Xalan v2.6.0. This component is only needed if you are not using an XML editor
          that comes with a styling engine built-in. This is a Java program. The latest version
          can be downloaded from the Apache Project site at <ulink url="http://xml.apache.org/"
          />. In order to execute Xalan you will also need a suitable Java runtime system
          installed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Formatting Object Processor</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>FOP v0.20.5. This component is only needed if you are not using an XML editor that
          comes with a formatting object processor built-in. This is also a Java program. The
          latest version can be downloaded from the Apache Project site at <ulink
            url="http://xml.apache.org/"/>. As with Xalan you will also need a suitable Java
          runtime system installed in order to execute FOP. Note that the current version of FOP
          is unfinished and it produces a number of errors when used with the stylesheets below.
          These errors can be ignored. The resulting document is servicable regardless.</para>

      <term>DocBook Stylesheets</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Stylesheets from Norman Walsh. This component is only needed if you are not using
          an XML editor that comes with DocBook stylesheets built-in. </para>

  <para>If you are not interested in rebuilding the documentation you do not need to read any
