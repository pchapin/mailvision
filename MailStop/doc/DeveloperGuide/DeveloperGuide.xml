    <para>This document is for people interested in working on the MailStop program itself. If you
      are only interested in using MailStop you do not need to read this document. If, on the other
      hand, you are interested in extending MailStop or in fixing a fault in the MailStop code base,
      you should review this document before you get started. This document assumes you are already
      familiar with MailStop and with the contents of the User Guide.</para>

    <para>MailStop is written in Ada. It also makes use of a number of additional libraries and
      tools, discussed in more detail elsewhere.</para>

    <para>MailStop is covered by the unmodified GNU Public License. This basically means that you
      are free to use it in any way that you wish as well as modify it as you desire. See the file
