<chapter id="Standards">
  <title>Supported Standards</title>

  <para>MailStop supports only open standards and evaluates incoming messages against those
    standards. MailStop follows the traditional policy of all Internet client programs by trying
    to accept any input that it can; however, MailStop will flag all standards violations that
    it sees. Furthermore MailStop will not normally allow any standards violations to occur in
    its outgoing communications.</para>

  <note>
    <para>MailStop does, however, have a raw message editor that allows you to edit outgoing
      messages in arbitrary ways. In the raw message editor MailStop's normal enforcement of
      mail standards is suspended. This allows you to experiment with sending various kinds of
      "broken" messages to other mail systems as a way of checking the behavior of those systems
      when getting such messages. It also allows you to (manually) use features that MailStop
      does not currently know about.</para>
  </note>

  <para>There are many standards related to email and it seems like new ones are created every
    month. MailStop can not know about every email standard. Since new standards are designed to
    layer on top of old standards, MailStop will handle many of the new standards by just
    leaving the data used by them uninterpreted. MailStop does allow you to view message text
    directly so that you can interpret the data in the messages yourself if necessary.</para>

  <para>The current version of MailStop understands the following standards.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>RFC-5321. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. MailStop does not currently implement any
        extensions.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>RFC-1939, together with the RFCs that update it. Post Office Protocol v3. MailStop
        supports this protocol fully but with no optional features.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>RFC-5322. Internet Message Format. MailStop has direct understanding of all the
        headers mentioned in the RFC, but no extension headers.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>RFC-2045, RFC-2046, RFC-2047, and RFC-2049, together with the RFCs that update
        these. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). MailStop tries to support MIME
        fully.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Future versions of MailStop may also support other standards such as SMTP extensions,
    digital signature and encryption standards, and various widely used extensions such as
    mailing list headers, vcards, and other things. It is also planned that eventually MailStop
    will support IMAP communications and the various standards associated with IMAP.</para>

  <para>In addition, the format of email messages as defined by RFC-5322 is a very old format,
    dating orginally back to the 1980s. A more modern approach to formatting structured and
    semi-structured documents is to use XML. The <ulink url="http://www.openhealth.org/xmtp/"
      >XMTP</ulink> proposal, as well as my own XEmail proposal are both attempts to to define
    an XML format for email messages. MailStop currently uses XEmail as a format for storing
    messages in abstract (post-parsed) form. A future version of MailStop may support XMTP as
    well.</para>
