    <para>MailStop is an email client. Unlike most email clients that try to hide the underlying
      structure of messages from their users, MailStop tries to expose that structure. What
      makes MailStop different from other clients is that it assumes its users are (or are
      interested in becoming) email experts. It thus allows the technical details of messages to
      be viewed, navigated, and edited. MailStop allows you to explicit specify (and convert
      between) various encoding methods, manipulate the nested subparts of complex multipart
      messages, and edit extension headers on messages, to name a few features. MailStop also
      allows you direct access to the low level email protocols it uses: SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.
      In addition to supporting the features of a day to day email application, MailStop can be
      used by mail administrators to help debug mail problems and by educators as an
      instructional tool.</para>

    <para>If you are interested in MailStop you might also be interested in MailFlux, an SMTP
      server with similar design goals. MailFlux is a mail server for experts.</para>
